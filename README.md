# ROOTExamples
Example analysis codes using cern ROOT (https://root.cern.ch/)

## ProofTreeAnalysis
This example shows how to build a stand alone program processing ROOT trees using the parallel ROOT facility, PROOF.
The TSelector class is generally used as a framework for this kind of analysis but it is often called from a ROOT commandline session or a ROOT macro. Building a stand alone project with cmake like this example enables you to develop your own Selector using an IDE and a debugger. This example is intended to be used as a template for students who are going to write their own Selector class.

### FillGaus
This program generates a sample tree data with random Gaussian events stored in ExampleDataClass objects.
It shows how to fill your own class objects to a ROOT tree, generate a ROOT dictionary, and build a shared library.

### ProofTreeAnalysis
This program processes the sample tree generated by the FillGaus program using TSelector class which is a framework for analyzing tree data provided in ROOT.
The ExampleSelector is derrived from the TSelector class and processes the input tree data and fills it to a histogram and a new tree.
It shows how to
- start PROOF processes from a stand alone program.
- pass arguments (parameters) to PROOF workers dynamically in the program.
- write a histogram or a tree object to a file.

It can run either on PROOF or as a local process. Switch off PROOF to debug your Selector.

## Installation
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```
You can use "module" to load paths
```
module use -a [install_dir]/share/modulefiles
module load ROOTExamples
```
or just add install/bin to your PATH and install/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you use Visual Studio 2019, clone this repository from [File]->[Clone or checkout code] and add a configuration "Linux-Debug" for building on a remote machine or "WSL-Debug" for your local Windows Subsystem for Linux. Then, [Build]->[install ROOTExamples] to install.

## Usage
Just execute the FillGaus then ProofTreeAnalysis
```
FillGaus
ProofTreeAnalysis
```

## Requirements
ROOT (v6.14.00 or greater) and cmake3 are required
