# ROOTExamples
Example analysis codes using cern ROOT (https://root.cern.ch/)

## ProofTreeAnalysis
This example shows how to build a stand alone program processing ROOT trees using the parallel ROOT facility, PROOF.
The TSelector class is generally used as a framework for this kind of analysis but it is often called from a ROOT commandline session or a ROOT macro. Building a stand alone project with cmake like this example enables you to develop your own Selector using an IDE and a debugger. This example is intended to be used as a template for students who are going to write their own Selector class.

### FillGaus
This program generates a sample tree data with random Gaussian events stored in ExampleDataClass objects.
It shows how to fill your own class objects to a ROOT tree, generate a ROOT dictionary, and build a shared library.

### ProofTreeAnalysis
This program processes the sample tree generated by the FillGaus program using TSelector class which is a framework for analyzing tree data provided in ROOT.
The ExampleSelector is derrived from the TSelector class and processes the input tree data and fills it to a histogram and a new tree.
It shows how to
- start PROOF processes from a stand alone program.
- pass arguments (parameters) to PROOF workers dynamically in the program.
- write a histogram or a tree object to a file.
It can run either on PROOF or as a local process. Switch off PROOF to debug your Selector.

## Installation
>mkdir build
>cd build
>cmake ..
>make install

## Usage
Just execute the FillGaus then ProofTreeAnalysis
>FillGaus
>ProofTreeAnalysis

## Requirements
ROOT6 and cmake3 are required
